## Ansible playbook - MEAN stack

This Vagrant and Virtualbox based Ansible playbook sets up a MEAN stack (Mongodb, Node + Express suitable for back-end for Angular SPAs).

### Instructions

* Install VirtualBox and Vagrant (make sure Vagrant is version 1.6.5 or later)
* Install Ansible
  * On MacBook Air and Pro, I had best results using Python's pip, which doesn't come with the version of Python that comes pre-installed on Macs. So if you have homebrew installed (and you should) you can do:

````
$ brew install python
$ sudo pip install ansible
````

* Clone this project to a folder where you keep your VMs
* First execute `vagrant box list` to check if `ubuntu/trusty64` is already on your laptop or desktop host system. If it isn't download the box with `vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64`.
* On the cammand-line in that folder, type `vagrant up`
* The process will take a while, on my 4GB RAM MacBook Pro it took about 10 minutes. But that's just the first time, once you have it provisioned it starts up again very quickly. A large part of the initial slowness is the one-time provisioning via Ansible of the MEAN components.
* Associate `http://mean01/` (or any other name you'd like) with local machine IP specified in the Vagrantfile (192.168.46.100 initially) by including the following line in `/etc/hosts`:

    192.168.46.100  mean01

* Within the guest VM box, if you do your work in, say, `/vagrant/dev/project01` then in the VM dir `./dev/project01` you can access the files with your favorite editor or IDE or else edit via ssh remoting.  
* If you create and run a node.js app on port 3000, you can access it in your browser by pointing it at `http://mean01:3000`.

### Vagrantfile

* Box used: [Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit (Trusty)](https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64)
